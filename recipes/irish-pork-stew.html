      <p>
        This Irish pork stew is a variation of corned beef and cabbage. And in
        case you didn't know, corned beef and cabbage is not typically eaten on
        St. Patrick's Day in Ireland.

      <ol class="ordered__list">
        <li>Season pork with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large pot over high heat. Working in batches, cook and
          stir pork in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes.
          Transfer pork to a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in the same pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in
          hot butter with a pinch of salt until onion is softened and
          translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; sauté until fragrant, about
          30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir flour into onion mixture; cook and stir until flour is completely
          incorporated, about 2 minutes. Add bay leaf and caraway seed; cook for
          2 minutes more. Pour in beer. Cook and stir until thickened, 1 to 3
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir browned pork, broth, carrots, and celery into beer mixture; bring
          to a simmer. Stir 1/4 cup parsley and balsamic vinegar into stew;
          reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until pork is fork-tender, about
          2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook
          Brussels sprouts in boiling water until almost tender, about 5
          minutes. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir Brussels sprouts into stew and simmer until heated through, about
          5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
