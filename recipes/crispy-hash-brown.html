      <h2 class="header__h2">How to make Hash Browns</h2>
      <p>
        Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy.
        First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a
        grater, food processor, or mandoline. Rinse the potatoes until the water
        is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid (this will
        ensure the hash browns are extra crispy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any
        other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but
        you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or
        multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil,
        about five minutes on each side.
